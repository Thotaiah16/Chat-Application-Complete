 üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
* npm (or yarn)

### ### Installation & Setup

#### ### 1. Backend Server (NestJS)

First, set up the server which will handle all the real-time communication.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend project folder
cd path/to/your/backend-folder

# 2. Install NPM packages
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run start:dev
```

* The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3001`.
* For testing, the required password is hardcoded as `mypassword` in `src/chat.gateway.ts`.

#### ### 2. Frontend Application (React)

Next, set up the client-side application.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend project folder
cd path/to/your/frontend-folder

# 2. Install NPM packages
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm start
```

* The React application will automatically open and run on `http://localhost:3000`.
* You can now open multiple browser tabs to simulate a conversation between different users.
